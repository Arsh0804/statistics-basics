    "Soln. Data is classified into two main categories: qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative data, also known as categorical data, describes qualities \n",

    "other), eye color (blue, brown, green), and the type of car (sedan, SUV, truck) are all qualitative data. This type of data helps in identifying different\n",
    "attributes and sorting them into specific categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, quantitative data describes quantities or amounts and is numeric in nature. This type of data can be further categorized into discret\n",
    "and continuous data. Discrete data includes countable items, such as the number of siblings one has (1, 2, 3, etc.), while continuous data can take any\n",
    "value within a range, such as height (150 cm, 160 cm, 170 cm) or weight (50 kg, 60 kg, 70 kg). Quantitative data is essential for calculations and \n",
    " statistical analysis, providing measurable evidence to support conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use four different scales of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nominal scale is used for labeling variables without any quantitative value. The categories are mutually exclusive but do not have a logical order. \n",
    "Examples of nominal data include types of fruits (apple, banana, orange) and blood types (A, B, AB, O). These categories provide a simple way to \n",
    "categorize data without implying any rank or order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ordinal scale, in contrast, deals with ordered categories. The intervals between the categories are not equal or known, but the data does possess\n",
    "a meaningful order. For instance, education levels can be categorized as high school, bachelor's, master's, and doctorate, and customer satisfaction \n",
    "ratings can be listed as satisfied, neutral, and unsatisfied. Although we can rank these categories, we cannot quantify the difference between them\n",
    "precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval data is numeric and features meaningful intervals between values, but it lacks a true zero point. This means that while we can measure the \n",
    "difference between values, the zero point does not indicate the absence of the quantity being measured. Examples of interval data include temperature \n",
    "scales (Celsius, Fahrenheit) and dates (2000, 2020). These measurements allow us to understand the magnitude of differences but do not allow for\n",
    "meaningful ratio comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, ratio data includes numeric values with a true zero point, enabling meaningful comparisons using both differences and ratios. This type of data\n",
    "is used for precise measurements where a zero value indicates the absence of the quantity. Examples of ratio data include height (150 cm, 160 cm), \n",

    "A random variable is a fundamental concept in statistics and probability theory. It is a variable that takes on different numerical values based on the \n",
    "outcome of a random phenomenon or experiment. Essentially, a random variable assigns a numerical value to each possible outcome in a sample space, \n",
    "allowing us to quantify and analyze the randomness inherent in various processes.\n",

    "Types of Random Variables\n",
    "Random variables can be classified into two main types: discrete random variables and continuous random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete Random Variables\n",
    "Discrete random variables are those that take on a countable number of distinct values. These values are often whole numbers, and there are gaps\n",
    "between possible values. Discrete random variables are typically used to model scenarios where outcomes can be counted, such as the number of successes\n",
    "in a series of trials or the number of defective items in a batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "The number of heads in 10 coin flips.\n",
    "The number of students present in a classroom.\n",
    "The number of cars passing through a toll booth in an hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these examples, the random variables can take on specific, countable values (e.g., 0, 1, 2, ..., 10 for the number of heads in coin flips).\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous Random Variables\n",
    "Continuous random variables are those that take on an infinite number of possible values within a given range. These values are typically real numbers,\n",
    "and there are no gaps between possible values. Continuous random variables are used to model scenarios where outcomes are measured rather than counted,\n",
    "and the measurements can take on any value within a continuous interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "The height of students in a class.\n",
    "The time it takes to run a marathon.\n",
    "The temperature measured over a day.\n",
    "In these examples, the random variables can take on any value within a specified range (e.g., any height within the possible range of human heights).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Differences\n",
    "Nature of Values:Discrete Random Variables: Take on countable, distinct values (e.g., whole numbers).\n",
    "Continuous Random Variables: Take on an infinite number of possible values within a range (e.g., real numbers).\n",

    "Continuous: Height, time, temperature.\n",

    "Representation:\n",
    "Discrete: Often represented by probability mass functions (PMFs), which give the probability of each possible value.\n",
    "Continuous: Often represented by probability density functions (PDFs), which describe the likelihood of the variable taking on a particular value \n",
